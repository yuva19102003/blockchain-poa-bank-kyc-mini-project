# Ethereum-Based KYC Framework for Improved Customer Verification in Banking

## Overview
This project introduces a **decentralized KYC verification system** using a private Ethereum blockchain network. By automating the KYC process, this system enhances security, reduces redundancy, and improves efficiency in customer onboarding for banks.

---

## Objective
- To mitigate money laundering by leveraging blockchain technology.
- To automate KYC data management for reduced time and operational costs.
- To ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof identity verification.

---

## Abstract
The framework utilizes a **private Ethereum blockchain** to streamline KYC processes. Key features include:
- **Smart contracts** for role-based access control, allowing only authorized entities to manage sensitive data.
- **Immutability and transparency** to reduce fraud and improve compliance.
- **Enhanced efficiency**, cutting costs and redundancy for both banks and customers.

## System Architecture

### Existing System
- **Challenges**:
  - Scalability issues.
  - Centralized control.
  - Privacy concerns.
  - Dependency on centralized oversight.

### Proposed System
- **Components**:
  - **Private Ethereum Network** with Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus.
  - **Smart Contracts** (`Admin.sol` and `Bank.sol`) for secure KYC registration and approval.
  - **MetaMask Integration** for blockchain interactions.
- **Advantages**:
  - High security, data integrity, transparency, efficiency, privacy, and cost savings.
